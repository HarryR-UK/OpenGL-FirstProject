# ABOUT

My first time using OpenGL for graphics processing. This is the first introduction to lower-level graphical applications.

The Libraries in this project consist of `GLEW` for providing us with the full range of OpenGL functionality,
`GLFW` is used for window managemen and input, and finally `GLM` for useful mathematical functions used with OpenGL.

I am using learnopengl.com as means of teaching the fundamentals, and also TheCherno on YouTube for some more indepth explanations on how OpenGL works.

# THE PROGRAM

The program is incredibly simple, all it is is is a transparent triangle which has real-time moving colors.

This is due to the help of shaders, which I am also beginning to learn.
